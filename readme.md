# HelloWorld-dotnet

I want to make something to learn .Net Core and C# better.

I'm referencing [.NET Core CLI Tools: Build a web API in 10 minutes](https://www.codingnagger.com/2018/01/25/dot-net-core-cli-tools-10-minutes-api/)

## To run

Run:

```
dotnet run --project HelloWorld
```

And visit:

[https://localhost:5001/WeatherForecast](https://localhost:5001/WeatherForecast)
